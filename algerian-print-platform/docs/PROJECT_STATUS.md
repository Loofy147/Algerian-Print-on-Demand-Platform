## 🚧 BLOCKERS & RISKS

### Active Blockers
1. None currently

### Potential Risks
1. **Dataset Quality**: May need more Arabic calligraphy samples
   - Mitigation: Commission local artists if needed

2. **Model Training Time**: Could take longer than expected
   - Mitigation: Use Colab Pro+ if Kaggle quota exceeded

3. **Print Partner Reliability**: Quality/timing issues
   - Mitigation: Have backup partner ready

4. **Payment Integration**: CIB API documentation may be lacking
   - Mitigation: Reach out to CIB developer support early
